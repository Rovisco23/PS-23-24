# Eletronic Construction Book

With this project we'll be focusing on the development of a platform to support the Electronic Construction Book.
This platform must be used to replace the traditional Construction Book (on paper), in which all the relevant
facts relating to the execution of licensed or authorized constructions, in order to provide information about
the development of the construction, which elucidates all those involved in the process of
execution of the construction, especially supervisors like municipal employees.
